# Overview

## Staff engineer archetypes

- **Tech Lead** guides the approach and execution of a particular team.

- **The Architect** is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area. They combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.

- **The Solver** digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward. Some focus on a given area for long periods. Others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.

- **The Right Hand** extends an executive’s attention, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations. They provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations.

## Tech Lead

- Manage/Tackle blocking task when required
- Delegating task
- Scoping task with PM
- Mentoring

## Architect

- Responsible for success of a specific technical domain.
- Maintaining intimate understanding of the business need and relevant constraints.
- Advocate for effective approach within their area of focus


## Solver

- The one who dabble with hard problem and doing it until it resolve (tech debt, etc)
- Solver operate in already identified problem (bugs, upcoming complexity)

## Right Hand

- Senior without direct managerial responsibilities
- Right hand dive into fire, edit the approach, delegate execution to the most appropriate team, and jump to the next fire

## Which are the right for you?

Choose something that energize you, you can discover it late or soon, it's different because of company size or culture.

## What do Staff engineer actually do?

> The role of a Staff-plus engineer depends a lot on what the team needs and also what the particular engineer’s strengths are. From my experience, the responsibilities of a Staff-plus engineer can change over time. Still, usually, their main focus is working on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team. - Diana Pojar

Keep doing much of what made them successful as Senior Engineers

- Building relationship
- Writing software
- Coordinating projects

But now it is auxiliary task, not the main task. But there are shared foundation on it

- Setting and editing technical direction
- Providing sponsorship and mentorship
- Injecting engineering context into organizational decisions
- exploration
- being glue ~ https://noidea.dog/glue

## Setting technical direction

Understand and solving the real needs, experiment after experiment.

## Mentorship and sponsorship

You’re far more likely to change your company’s long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics.

Sharing your experience and advice.

## Providing engineering perspective

Effective orgs streamline routine decision making. Staff engineer will often get unexpectedly pulled into the room where something need discussion happen.

Just remember that you're representing the interests of all engineering, not just your own.

## Exploration

Prototyping, care towards DX. Always try something that improve company business.

## Being Glue

Doing the needed, but often invisible task to keep the team moving forward and ship.

## Will you still write software?

It depends. You should still remember that your decision should based on-the-ground experiences to the rest of your team.

More of the job will be about mentoring and growing people around you. Sometimes it's hard to metric.

## Slow but rewarding

Timeframes are longer. 

## Does title even matter
