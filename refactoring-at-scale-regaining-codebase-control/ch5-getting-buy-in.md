# CH 5 Getting Buy-In

Make managers approve your refactoring project

- Evaluate your refactoring for bussiness goal
- Tell the risk
- Check where will be the right time to do big refactor


## Initial Conversation

> Instead of steamrolling your manager with all of the information you’ve gathered to date, consider asking them for their opinion first. It can be as simple as kicking off a conversation during your one-on-one with, “I’ve been thinking about how X is affecting our ability to do Y and I wanted to know whether you had any thoughts about it.”By soliciting their opinion, you’re indicating to your manager that you value their point of view. You’re giving them an important opportunity to be honest with you.

- Compliment their thought process
- Present the counter argument
