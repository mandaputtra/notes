# CH 9 Making the refactor stick

## Fostering Adoption

Quite often, a large number of engineers will need to interact with your refactor. You need these engineers’ support for the refactor and the patterns it established for two reasons

- Change introduced are long term
- You need engineers to support the code

## Education

- Make presentation what are wrong on the old code and right thing to do in the new code.
- Point out some mistake that happen in old code
- Workshops/Engineering gathering
- Share some insight after refactoring done
- Discuss what make the product became so complex
- Describe your solution

## Integrate the improvement into the culture

We should encourage and facilitate design conversations on our team frequently, seeking others’ feedback early rather than forging ahead on our own. Code reviews are not only an opportunity for someone to double-check our work, but also a chance for an open discussion about how we can make our solution just that much better. As code authors, we should consider annotating our code reviews with specific questions for our reviewers. As reviewers, we should be just as analytical when reviewing our peers’ code as we are when we are writing code ourselves.
