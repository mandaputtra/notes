# CH7 Communication

## Within Your Team

> If your team is not already communicating effectively on a frequent basis, maybe you should consider delaying a large refactoring project until after your team has taken the time to iron out its difficulties. Your team might be suffering from a number of problems. Maybe you’re working with a team with conflicting egos, or teammates who spend more time talking than listening. Whatever you’re struggling with, your team won’t be able to execute well (if at all) on a crucial project without addressing its communication issues. Quite a few resources are available on how to improve team communication, but I recommend picking up a copy of Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication.

> Third, large-scale refactors can drag on for a while. You’ll need to be able to give your fellow engineers honest feedback throughout the project so that you can continue to work together effectively.

- Stand Up
- Weekly Sync
- Retrospectives

## Outside Your Team

- Use docs to document the change
- Some required knowledge that other team should have

1. Where stakeholders can find information about the current stage of the refactor
2. Where stakeholders can find a high-level project timeline
3. Where engineers can expect to find technical information about the refactor
4. Where stakeholders can ask questions
5. When affected teams should expect to hear from you

## During Process Execution

- Announce the kick off
- Share the execution plan
