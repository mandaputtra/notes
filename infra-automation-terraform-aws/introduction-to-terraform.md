# Introduction to Terraform

Write your infrastructure as code. Instead of manually configuring your infrastructure you can use code to automate it.

Can keep your infrastructure at certain state.

Make infrastructure auditable. 

Terraform are used to provisioning your infrastructure. Meaning that it supply what your infrastructure needs, like how many database you want to spin, how many load balancer you want to use, what are the access, etc. It can run on AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

Terraform doesn't install software it only describe what infrastructure your software needs. But you can use Terraform to do this also with help of Chef, Ansible and other similiar tools.
