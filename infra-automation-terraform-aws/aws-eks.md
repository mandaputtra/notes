- Elastic container service for kubernetees
- Alternative to AWS ECS (AWS Specific)
- Managed kubernetees
- Master nodes scale automatically
- multi-AZ (https://aws.amazon.com/id/rds/features/multi-az/)
- For smaller setup ECS is cheaper
- Kubernetees are more popular than ECS, ECS has tight integration with AWS
