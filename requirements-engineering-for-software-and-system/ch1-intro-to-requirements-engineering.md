# Intro to Requirements Engineering

Poor requirement analysis cloud create a poor management in software system. Thus creating a bad software overall. 

## What is Requirement Engineering

Requirements engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the real-world goals for, functions of, and constraints on systems. It is also concerned with the relationship of these factors to precise specifications of system behavior and to their evolution over time and across families of related systems.

## You'd probably don't do enough requirement engineering

Most people have difficulties scaling up requirements engineering in terms of activity scope and the structure of requirement artifacts.

## What are Requirements?

Requirements are the end meet of many stakeholders or people involved on the development of a software.

### Requirement vs Goals

_Goals_ are high level objective, organization, or system, but _requirement_ specifies how goal should be accomplished by a proposed system.

### Requirement level Classifications

- User requirement : User requirements are abstract statements written in natural language with accompanying informal diagrams.
- System requirement : System requirements are detailed descriptions of the services and constraints.
- Design Specification : Finally, design specifications emerge from the analysis and design documentation used as the basis for implementation by developers

### Requirement Specification Test

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements (FRs) describe the services the system should provide and how the system will react to its inputs.
